# Lemizh-Neogrammarian
This is the software I use to create words for my [conlang Lemizh](https://lemizh.conlang.org/). Starting e.g. from a Proto-Indo-European word, Neogrammarian applies sound changes and (to some extent) grammatical and semantic changes. It also knows about a dozen other languages, partly real and partly fictional, that serve as sources for loanwords.

Maybe not particularly useful to anybody, but I donâ€™t want to hide it on my laptop either.
